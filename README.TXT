TechSupport - the DodgySoft Technical support system, version #2.

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition
   David J. Barnes and Michael KÃ¶lling

This project is discussed in chapter 6.


This project implements a second version of the technical support system 
example. It is an intermediate version intended to demonstrate the first
few changes discussed in this book chapter.


To start this program, create a SupportSystem object and execute the "start" 
method.

Then start describing your problem by typing in the terminal window.

part ii:
q25. yes, for example HashMap<String, String>
     replace(K key, V value)
     replace(K key, V oldValue, V newValue)
     putIfAbsent(K key, V value)
     remove(Object key, Object value)
     put(K key, V value)
     containsValue(Object Value)
q26. size()
q28. gets replaced
q29. you have two keys which return the same thing
q30. containsKey(object key)
     for example, with the phonebook
     return containsKey("John Doe");
q31. returns null
q32. keySet()
q34. a HashSet isnt ordered, and cant contains duplicates, whereas an ArrayList is and can
q35. an ArrayList returns an object of any type, whereas a HashSet will return a String (an object) or an integer
q36. no as a String stores spaces like any other character and the reader trims them all away anyway
q37. i know the lab is about hashsets, hashmaps, and the like, but it was refusing to work with a hashset so it implemented an arraylist

q46. no not really, everything is there but its not very helpful, its missing the desription for several methods
q47. @version @author @return, they define special sections of the doc
q48.
